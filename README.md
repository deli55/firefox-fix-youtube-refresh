This Firefox add-on attempts to fix the refresh issue on YouTube that occurs when your video is paused for a long time or when you change the default audio device (for example, by plugging in new headphones). This issue often causes the video to roll back several minutes or even hours from its original progress.

By default, the new button may appear in your Extensions submenu on the toolbar. You can drag it, or any other add-on button out into the open on the toolbar for easier access.

When you click the button, it fetches the current playback time of the YouTube video and then refreshes the page, effectively bypassing the issue caused by a standard page refresh.
