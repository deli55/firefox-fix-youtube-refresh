This firefox addon attempts to fix the refresh issue on youtube if your video is paused for a long time or you change the audio device.

By default the button might be in your extention submenu in the toolbar, you can drag it or any other addon out in the open so you can click it easily.

By clicking the button, it fetches the current time of the youtube video and then refreshes the page, thus bypassing the issue of regular page refresh causing your youtube video to go back minutes or sometimes hours from actual progress.
